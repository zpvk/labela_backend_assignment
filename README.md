## üßë‚Äçüíª Developer Local Setup 

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```
git clone https://github.com/zpvk/labela_backend_assignment.git
cd your-repository
```
### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Step 4: Set Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following variables:
```
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=my_secret_key
DB_NAME=my_database
DB_USER=my_user
DB_PASSWORD=my_password
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
```

### Step 5: Run PostgreSQL Server (If not using Docker)
Make sure your PostgreSQL server is running, and the database and user specified in the `.env` file are created.

### Step 6: Apply Migrations
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```
### Step 7: Create a Superuser (for accessing the admin panel)
```
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
### Step 8: Run the Development Server
```
python manage.py runserver
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Developer Docker Setup

### Step 4: Create Admin user
```
docker compose run web python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## User Stories and API Endpoints
### Access Swagger UI For Quick View Endpoints
I have also implemented Swagger, but it is not automatically generated with the Swagger library. Instead, I have integrated it using the Postman collection. Kindly utilize Postman for API testing
Visit http://localhost:8000/api/swagger-ui/ to explore the implemented API endpoints.
